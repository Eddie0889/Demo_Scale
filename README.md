EECS 4443 Lab 4 

This lab teaches us how to use the GestureDetector class in the android.view API. 
The requirements are to have the image be zoomed in when the user double taps on 
the image and to have a unique feature implemented. The unique feature was to ensure
that the image never went off the viewing pane.
